# vim-wizard

A [Colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/colortemplate) rewrite of the [Apprentice](https://github.com/romainl/Apprentice) Vim colourscheme with many tweaks to make it more similar to its origins.

## Backstory

[Apprentice was created](https://gist.github.com/romainl/1f252ce8c854fda211fcb815b0b9f94a) out of a wish to have a version of the [Sorcerer](https://jeetblogs.org/post/sorcerer/) colourscheme that looked the same in a terminal limited to 256 colours and in a GUI environment. It seems that many of the colours in Apprentice are _technically_ the most similar 256 colour to the Sorcerer equivalent, but are actually often very different. Wizard makes some changes to the colour palette that aims to stay as close in line with [Sorcerer](https://jeetblogs.org/post/sorcerer/) as possible. A good example of this is the orange colour: Apprentice uses an orange far more saturated and bright than the one Sorcerer uses, but it just happens to be the closest 256 colour. Wizard, on the other hand, picks an orange that is further away from the original colour if you measure it, but _feels_ closer to the original colour.
